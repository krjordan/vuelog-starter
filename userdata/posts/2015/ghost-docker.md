title: Ghost & Docker
category: docs
------------------------

Since I have had this blog up and running, I've been using ghost with a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) virtual machine. If you're looking to go that route, I have written a quick tutorial on that [here](http://mycodingblog.com/up-and-running-with-ghost-and-digital-ocean/). I have not had any issues, but since I have been using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) more and more, I decided it was finally time to throw my blog into a container. I have to admit, it took a few days and a bit of research. Maybe I'm still new at this whole coding thing, I know I have a ton to learn, but seriously?

I ran into a few hiccups, but I did finally find a solution. I am using the [Official Docker Ghost Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/). It briefly describes how to get it up and running. Well, almost... The commands given will end up giving you an error:

Reading the comments didn't help me much, but did get me pointed in the right direction. It appears that ghost has permission issues when running in production. However, [@snnd](https://github.com/snnd) posted this little [gem](https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle).

So I did what he said and it didn't work. I had to make some more changes to the <code class="language-none">start.sh</code> file. In all fairness, it is most likely my fault, but I was able to get it to work.

## Let's Make a Ghost Container!

Be sure to copy your <code class="language-none">content</code> folder if you already have a ghost blog up and running. If you don't, you can add these [folders](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master/content) or use the ones from the [repo](https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle) mentioned earlier and place them where ever you want your ghost files to live on your host. You will also need a config file. I did a <code class="language-git">git clone https://github.com/snnd/docker-ghost-bundle.git</code> and changed the directory name to <code class="language-none">mycodingblog/</code>.

I also added all of my data, images and theme files to the appropriate directories. Next, I edited the <code class="language-none">mycodingblog/config/config.js</code> file:

```javascript
var path = require('path'),
		config;

config = {
	production: {
		url: 'http://mycodingblog.com/',
		mail: {},
		database: {
			client: 'sqlite3',
			connection: {
				filename: path.join('/usr/src/ghost/content/data/ghost.db')
			},
			debug: true
		},

		server: {
			host: '0.0.0.0',
			port: '2368'
		}
	}
};

module.exports = config;
```

Then I edited the <code class="language-none">start.sh</code> file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

docker run -d --name mycodingblog \
	-p 8080:2368 \
	-e VIRTUAL_HOST=mycodingblog.com \
	-e NODE_ENV=production \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/themes:/usr/src/ghost/content/themes \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/apps:/usr/src/ghost/content/apps \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/images:/usr/src/ghost/content/images \
	-v /mycodingblog/content/data:/usr/src/ghost/content/data \
	-v /mycodingblog/config:/var/lib/ghost \
	ghost
```

Then I typed <code class="language-none">./start.sh</code>. Of course this was after playing around with it for a few hours. Make sure to use the <code class="language-none">-d</code> flag to run in detached mode. It started up and told me to point my browser to <code class="language-none">http://mycodingblog.com</code>. So now you should have a ghost container up and running.
